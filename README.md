# **This is a forked repository from [GeoCLIP](https://github.com/VicenteVivan/geo-clip)!!**

- Added the missing module ``misc.py``, which is needed to run the code. 
- Added the inverse function to of equal earth projection to convert from x/y to lat/lon.
- Currently constructing a LocationDecoder class to decode the location from the image embedding directly.
